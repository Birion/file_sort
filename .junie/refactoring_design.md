# File Sort Refactoring Design

## Original Structure

The original codebase had the following structure:

- `main.rs`: Entry point that called `perform_processing_based_on_configuration`
- `lib.rs`: Defined the module structure and exported commonly used items
- `configuration.rs`: Contained the `Config` struct and functions for loading and processing configuration
- `processor/`: Contained the `Processor` struct and methods for file processing
  - `core.rs`: Defined the `Processor` struct and its basic methods
  - `file_operations.rs`: Implemented file operations (copy/move)
  - `path_handling.rs`: Implemented path handling methods
  - `pattern_matching.rs`: Implemented pattern matching methods
  - `format_conversion.rs`: Implemented file format conversion
- `folder_function.rs`: Implemented transformative functions for directories
- `rules.rs`: Defined the `Rule` struct and related types

The original workflow was:

1. Read the configuration from a file
2. Get the list of files from the download directory
3. Process patterns in each rule
4. For each file, try to apply each rule
   - If a rule matches, perform the file action (move/copy)
   - If a rule has a transformative function, use it to generate the new destination filename
   - If a rule has a conversion function, apply it before any other file operations

## Current Structure

The refactored codebase now has the following structure:

- `main.rs`: Entry point that calls the workflow engine
- `lib.rs`: Defines the module structure and exports commonly used items
- `config/`: Contains configuration loading and data structures
  - `mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
  - `loader.rs`: Functions for loading and validating configuration
  - `model.rs`: Data structures for configuration (Config, Rule, etc.)
- `discovery/`: Contains file discovery functionality
  - `mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
  - `scanner.rs`: Functions for scanning directories and finding files
  - `matcher.rs`: Functions for matching files against rules
- `path_gen/`: Contains path generation functionality
  - `mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
  - `transformer.rs`: Functions for applying transformative functions
  - `pattern.rs`: Functions for pattern matching and replacement
- `file_ops/`: Contains file operations functionality
  - `mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
  - `converter.rs`: Functions for file format conversion
  - `actions.rs`: Functions for file operations (copy/move)
- `workflow/`: Contains workflow orchestration
  - `mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
  - `engine.rs`: Orchestrates the workflow steps
  - `context.rs`: Defines the context passed between steps
- `folder_function.rs`: Implements transformative functions for directories (unchanged)
- `rules.rs`: Defines the Rule struct and related types (partially moved to config/model.rs)
- `processor/`: Contains the old implementation (kept for backward compatibility)

The new workflow cleanly separates each step:

### 1. Configuration Module (`config/`)

- `config/mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
- `config/loader.rs`: Functions for loading and validating configuration
- `config/model.rs`: Data structures for configuration (Config, Rule, etc.)

### 2. File Discovery Module (`discovery/`)

- `discovery/mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
- `discovery/scanner.rs`: Functions for scanning directories and finding files
- `discovery/matcher.rs`: Functions for matching files against rules

### 3. Path Generation Module (`path_gen/`)

- `path_gen/mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
- `path_gen/transformer.rs`: Functions for applying transformative functions
- `path_gen/pattern.rs`: Functions for pattern matching and replacement

### 4. File Operations Module (`file_ops/`)

- `file_ops/mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
- `file_ops/converter.rs`: Functions for file format conversion
- `file_ops/actions.rs`: Functions for file operations (copy/move)

### 5. Workflow Module (`workflow/`)

- `workflow/mod.rs`: Exports the public interface
- `workflow/engine.rs`: Orchestrates the workflow steps
- `workflow/context.rs`: Defines the context passed between steps

## Workflow Steps

The new workflow will be:

1. **Configuration Loading**:
   - Load configuration from file
   - Validate configuration
   - Return a validated Config object

2. **File Discovery**:
   - Scan the download directory for files
   - For each file, check if any rule applies
   - Return a list of (file, matching rule) pairs

3. **Path Generation**:
   - For each (file, rule) pair:
     - Generate the destination path
     - If the rule has a transformative function, apply it
   - Return a list of (source path, destination path, rule) tuples

4. **File Operations**:
   - For each (source, destination, rule) tuple:
     - If the rule has a conversion function, apply it
     - Perform the file operation (copy/move)
   - Return success or failure for each operation

## Implementation Plan

1. ✓ Create the new directory structure
2. ✓ Move and adapt existing code to the new structure
3. ✓ Implement the workflow module to orchestrate the steps
4. ✓ Update the main entry point to use the new workflow
5. ✓ Verify that the refactored code works correctly
6. ⚠️ Clean up and finalize the code (partially completed)

## Backward Compatibility

During the refactoring process, we've maintained backward compatibility by:

1. Keeping the old `processor/` module intact while creating new modules
2. Updating tests to work with the new structure while preserving tests for the old structure
3. Marking tests for functionality that has been moved to new modules as `#[ignore]`

This approach allows for a gradual transition to the new structure without breaking existing code. In a future update, once all code is using the new modules, the old `processor/` module can be removed.

## Current Status

The refactoring is mostly complete, with all tests passing (66 passed, 0 failed, 3 ignored). There are some warnings about unused code in the old `processor/` module, which is expected since we're transitioning away from it.

## Future Improvements

1. Remove the old `processor/` module once all code is using the new modules
2. Add more comprehensive documentation for the new modules
3. Add more tests for edge cases in the new modules
4. Optimize performance where possible

## Benefits

- Each step is isolated and has a clear responsibility
- The workflow is more explicit and easier to understand
- The code is more modular and easier to maintain
- New features can be added more easily
- Testing is simplified as each step can be tested independently
- Error handling is more consistent and informative
