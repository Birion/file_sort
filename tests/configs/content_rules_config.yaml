        operator: gt
        value: "5000000"  # 5MB
      - property: mime_type
        operator: contains
        value: "image/"
    match_all_conditions: true  # Both conditions must match (AND logic)
    directory: C:/Media/LargeImages

  # Rule for text files containing "TODO"
  - title: TODO Text Files
