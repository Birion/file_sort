# File Sort (fsort) Improvement Tasks

This document contains a comprehensive list of actionable improvement tasks for the File Sort utility. Each task is
logically ordered and covers both architectural and code-level improvements.

## Code Quality and Structure

1. [x] Refactor error handling to use custom error types instead of anyhow::Error for more specific error messages
2. [x] Implement a proper logging system with different verbosity levels instead of direct println! calls
3. [x] Add comprehensive documentation comments to all public functions and types
4. [x] Extract hardcoded constants to a dedicated configuration module
5. [ ] Improve code organisation by splitting large files into smaller, more focused modules
6. [ ] Implement proper error propagation instead of using unwrap() and expect()
7. [ ] Add input validation for configuration files with helpful error messages
8. [ ] Refactor the Processor struct to follow the builder pattern for better readability
9. [ ] Implement proper unit tests for all core functionality

## Feature Enhancements

10. [ ] Add support for multiple configuration files with inheritance
11. [ ] Implement a dry-run mode with detailed output of planned operations
12. [ ] Add support for file-content-based rules using file metadata or content analysis
13. [ ] Implement parallel processing for file operations to improve performance
14. [ ] Add support for conditional rules based on file properties (size, date, content type)
15. [ ] Implement a configuration wizard for creating new config files
16. [ ] Add support for environment variable expansion in configuration paths
17. [ ] Implement a plugin system for custom processors
18. [ ] Add support for different configuration formats (TOML, INI) in addition to YAML
19. [ ] Implement incremental processing (only process new or changed files)

## User Experience

20. [ ] Add progress indicators for operations on large numbers of files
21. [ ] Implement colorized output for better visual distinction (expand current implementation)
22. [ ] Add an interactive mode for confirming file operations
23. [ ] Improve error messages with suggestions for resolution
24. [ ] Add a verbose mode for detailed logging
25. [ ] Implement a configuration validation command with helpful error messages
26. [ ] Add a command to list all available rules in the configuration
27. [ ] Implement a simulation mode that shows what would happen without making changes
28. [ ] Add support for undo operations

## Testing and Reliability

29. [ ] Expand unit test coverage for core components
30. [ ] Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
31. [ ] Implement property-based testing for rule processing
32. [ ] Add stress testing for large file collections
33. [ ] Implement automated regression testing
34. [ ] Add benchmarking tools for performance testing
35. [ ] Implement error recovery mechanisms for failed operations
36. [ ] Add transaction-like operations to ensure atomicity of file movements

## Documentation

37. [ ] Create comprehensive user documentation with examples
38. [ ] Add inline code documentation for better maintainability
39. [ ] Create a quick-start guide for new users
40. [ ] Document common patterns and use cases
41. [ ] Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues
42. [ ] Create a changelog to track version changes
43. [ ] Document the configuration file format with examples
44. [ ] Add architecture documentation explaining the design decisions

## Performance Optimisation

45. [ ] Optimize regex compilation and reuse
46. [ ] Add caching for frequently used patterns and transformations
47. [ ] Implement lazy loading of configuration files
48. [ ] Optimise file system operations by batching similar operations
49. [ ] Reduce memory usage for large file collections
50. [ ] Implement more efficient pattern matching algorithms

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

51. [ ] Ensure proper path handling on different operating systems
52. [ ] Add platform-specific optimisations for file operations
53. [ ] Implement proper Unicode support for filenames
54. [ ] Ensure configuration paths work correctly on all supported platforms
55. [ ] Add support for platform-specific file attributes

## Security

56. [ ] Implement proper permission checking before file operations
57. [ ] Add safeguards against moving system or critical files
58. [ ] Implement configuration file validation to prevent malicious configurations
59. [ ] Add support for secure credential storage for remote file operations
60. [ ] Implement proper handling of symbolic links and hard links
