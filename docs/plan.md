# File Sort Improvement Plan

## Project Overview

File Sort (fsort) is a utility designed to automatically organise files by moving them from a download directory to
appropriate target directories based on configurable rules. The application uses pattern matching to identify files and
apply transformations to determine their destination.

## Key Goals and Constraints

### Goals

1. **File Organisation Automation**: Automatically sort and organise files based on their names and patterns.
2. **Configurability**: Allow users to define custom sorting rules through a configuration file.
3. **Pattern Matching**: Use regex patterns to match files and extract relevant parts of filenames.
4. **Path Transformation**: Transform file paths based on extracted patterns and apply additional processing.
5. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Support both Windows and Unix-like systems.
6. **User-Friendly Interface**: Provide a simple CLI with clear feedback on operations.

### Constraints

1. **Configuration Format**: Must use YAML or JSON for configuration files.
2. **File Operations**: Limited to moving or copying files (no renaming without moving).
3. **Pattern Matching**: Relies on regex for pattern matching, which may be complex for non-technical users.
4. **Error Handling**: Must handle file system errors gracefully.
5. **Performance**: Should efficiently process large numbers of files.

## Improvement Areas

### 1. User Experience

#### Rationale

The current CLI interface is minimal and could benefit from additional features to improve usability. Better feedback
and more intuitive commands would make the tool more accessible to users.

#### Proposed Changes

- Add progress indicators for operations on large numbers of files
- Implement colorized output for better visual distinction (already partially implemented)
- Add a verbose mode for detailed logging
- Improve error messages with suggestions for resolution
- Add an interactive mode for confirming file operations

### 2. Configuration Management

#### Rationale

The configuration system works but could be enhanced to provide more flexibility and ease of use. Better defaults and
validation would reduce user errors.

#### Proposed Changes

- Add configuration validation with helpful error messages
- Implement a configuration wizard for creating new config files
- Support environment variable expansion in paths
- Add the ability to include other configuration files
- Implement configuration versioning for backward compatibility
- Add support for different configuration formats (e.g. TOML, INI)

### 3. Rule System Enhancement

#### Rationale

The rule system is powerful but could be extended to handle more complex scenarios and provide more flexibility in file
organisation.

#### Proposed Changes

- Add support for nested rules with inheritance
- Implement conditional rules based on file properties (size, date, content type)
- Add support for custom scripting or plugins for advanced transformations
- Implement rule prioritization and conflict resolution
- Add support for file-content-based rules (e.g. metadata extraction)

### 4. Performance Optimisation

#### Rationale

For large file collections, performance could become an issue. Optimising the core processing loop and adding parallel
processing would improve efficiency.

#### Proposed Changes

- Implement parallel processing for file operations
- Add caching for frequently used patterns and transformations
- Optimize regex compilation and reuse
- Implement incremental processing (only process new or changed files)
- Add benchmarking tools for performance testing

### 5. Testing and Reliability

#### Rationale

Comprehensive testing is essential for a file manipulation tool to prevent data loss or corruption. Enhanced testing
would improve reliability.

#### Proposed Changes

- Expand unit test coverage for core components
- Add integration tests for end-to-end workflows
- Implement property-based testing for rule processing
- Add stress testing for large file collections
- Implement automated regression testing

### 6. Documentation

#### Rationale

Good documentation is crucial for user adoption and understanding. Comprehensive and clear documentation would make the
tool more accessible.

#### Proposed Changes

- Create comprehensive user documentation with examples
- Add inline code documentation for better maintainability
- Create a quick-start guide for new users
- Document common patterns and use cases
- Add a troubleshooting guide for common issues

### 7. Extensibility

#### Rationale

Making the system more extensible would allow for future growth and adaptation to new use cases without major rewrites.

#### Proposed Changes

- Implement a plugin system for custom processors
- Add support for custom output formats (e.g. reports)
- Create hooks for pre-/post-processing events
- Design a modular architecture for easier component replacement
- Add an API for programmatic usage

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Short-term (1–3 months)**
    - Improve error handling and user feedback
    - Enhance documentation
    - Add configuration validation
    - Implement basic performance optimisations

2. **Medium-term (3–6 months)**
    - Develop an enhanced rule system
    - Implement parallel processing
    - Create a configuration wizard
    - Expand test coverage

3. **Long-term (6+ months)**
    - Implement plugin system
    - Add content-based rules
    - Create advanced scripting capabilities
    - Develop comprehensive benchmarking

## Conclusion

The File Sort utility provides a solid foundation for automated file organisation. By implementing the improvements
outlined in this plan, the tool can become more powerful, user-friendly, and adaptable to a wider range of use cases.
The focus should be on enhancing user experience and extending functionality while maintaining the core simplicity that
makes the tool effective.
